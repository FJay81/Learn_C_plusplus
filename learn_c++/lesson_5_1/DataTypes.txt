When we create variables we define its data type eg int x or double y.
This language is statically typed so once a variable has a data type it stays that type.
With data types we always know what type of data is going going to be stored, this allows us to know how to use said variable.
Data types:
    integrel - like int but larger variety
    char - characters
    floating point - fractional/decimal numbers, float and double
    bool - True/False
    arrays - like a list for a specific data type, eg array of Ints 
    structs/classes - custom?
    classes - oop 
    string - sequence of chars 

integrel:
    int - Usually 32 bit but always min 16 bit
