In control fow we have branching and we have looping.
These are the main basis for any app.
With branching we use if statements and switch statements.
With loops its While, for and do-while loops.

if statement:
  
    if(expression)//This will be true or false  //Execute when true
        {
            _code_
        }

    elseif(expression)//This will be true or false  //Execute when true
        {
            _code_
        }

    else//Will run if others are false
        {
            _code_
        }


switch statement:
    
    switch(variable)
    {
        case 17://equivalent to if
            _code_
            break
        case _summat else_://equivalent to elseif
            _code_
            break
        default://equivalent to else
            _code_
            break
    }

switch is only int types and only exact values. If statements are better, switches are useful for limited options.
