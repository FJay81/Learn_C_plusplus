Main function is always called when started
Like python function when you run custom function it can have no data passed thruogh like 'pow();'
Or it can have arguments like 'pow(10, 2);'
If the function doesnt output use semi-colon, this is like if you want to assign it to something.
But if the function doesnt have semi-colon then its becuase it looks something like 'int x = pow(10,2) * 5;'
Where the semi-colon is after the thing.

We can make our own functions which do something
Instead copying and pasting the same thing a 100 times we can put the code into a function.
We give this function an identifier such as 'do_this'
Then when we want to call it all we do is call it like how we would call pow.
This allows us to edit and adjust the functioins really easily.

We create functions like:

int multiply(int x, int y)
{
    x = x * x *y;
    return x;
}

defines ^ function, also declares it. Have to declare before calling it

And can run them like:

multiply (7, 57);

calls ^ function 

Or:

int x = 6
multiply (x, 57)

Or:

int new = multiply(9, 6)

Or whatever you feel like
